# Housing Price Prediction With Geospatial Analysis
Raw notes on California housing price prediction (regression) with geospatial analysis. Includes scratch implementation of dataset scraping and data splitting. This notebook is a revised example with geospatial analysis using geopandas and folium from Chapter 2 of the book "Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow."

When running this notebook outside Kaggle:
- Packages such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, folium, and geopandas need to be installed first
- To view interactive folium (leaflet) plot, set the notebook to Trusted
- File paths need to be edited
